*Framer is an simple web app combined with a Python program. With the above two it can make pixel-by-pixel computer animations.
The below are the details of different versions of Framer, I'm constantly adding more.*


**Framer v.0**

This is the very first version of Framer created around the May of 2020. This version only allows you to make 9 by 16 animations, since not much Javascript is applyed to it. 

Also, the method of the web app (The HTML, CSS and Javascript combined) sending frames to the Python file is not the optimal: It sends the data "pixel by pixel" in an array-in-array data structure to the Python program.
